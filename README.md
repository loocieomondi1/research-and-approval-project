## Overview

This project is composed of three different components: the headless backend, the storefront, and the admin dashboard.

ext.js storefront is a 100% ready-to-use  storefront template. It comes with all ecommerce storefront features such as product display, featured products, shopping cart, checking out, multiple payment processing, and more.

[PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/ng/home/) is a payment provider used by millions around the world. It allows customers to purchase orders from your website using their PayPal account rather than the need to enter their card details.

[Paystack](https://paystack.com/) is the #1 African payment gateway that helps businesses to accept online payments through their ecommerce stores, websites, and applications. Paystack provides other services such as point-of-sale (PoS), payment through an invoice, and more.
